# Exercise #3 - Text on images - The blur-filter

In our file index.html we have a setup of two cards.

Each card should get a random image.

The image should be placed inside a pseudo element.

We want to show some text on top of everything.

The left image should have no filter applied on the background image.

The right image should get a slightly blurred background on hover to increase readability of the text. 

See the concrete instrunctions in the file index.html.

Bored? Try to write all CSS on your own. Use the file index-no-css.html 

At the end you can compare the left image text with the right image text. Compare the readability.

Endresult:

Good luck!
